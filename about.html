		<p>Pixel art is a form of digital art, created through the use of software, where images are edited on the pixel level. The aesthetic for this kind of graphics comes from 8-bit and 16-bit computers and video game consoles, in addition to other limited systems such as graphing calculators.</p>

		<h1>animator</h1>
		<img class="equip" src="images/my animation.gif" alt="animation">
		<p>Being an animator is a passion I have had ever since I could remember, I loved to do art but I wanted to make my art move and do things. I enjoyed watching anime and how the animators would animate the fight scenes or the expressions on a character's face. I wanted to do something similiar to that thus started my adventure of being an animator, it wasn't easy at first but I became more of a fast learner when it came to doing these things.</p>

		<h1>Artist</h1>
		<img class="equip" src="images/icon2.png" alt="art">
		<p>Being an artist isn't the easiest thing, there is always gonna be someone better than you, I learned that at a very young age. I studied art to the point I could do things with that. I do still have issues when it comes to body parts or the head but it is something I can't solve with more practice and studying.</p>
		<ul class="items">
			<li>traditional: it's something I have always done ever since I could remember, it comes more naturally than any other type of style</li>
			<li>Digital: it's something I have struggled with in the past but I also have learned how to get around that issue.</li>
			<li>3D art: it is something I struggle with the most due to it being very new to me.</li>
